                <h2 class="section-title">The Project</h2>
                <p class="section-para">Our task was to conceptualize, develop, evaluate, and refine the user experience for a hypothetical app to provide Massachusetts residents to store, track, and display their COVID vaccination status and test results. We were provided with a broad list of functional requirements and given free rein to determine how those tasks would be carried out and what the user interface would look like.</p>
                <p class="section-para">At the beginning of the project cycle, vaccinations were new and many public spaces wanted proof of inoculation or test results. The paper vaccinations cards were flimsy and inconveniently sized. Test results came in a variety of formats, depending on the provider. At the time, a robust, cohesive solution seemed necessary to expedite the process for people—and hopefully encourage the normalization of requiring and offering proof of vaccination.</p>
                <p class="section-para">I worked with a team of three other designers to carry out each phase of the design. We took equal parts in early requirement gathering and ideation, wireframing and mock-ups, user testing and evaluation, and final design production. My strengths turned out to be an affinity for quick sketching/prototyping and an eye for novel interface elements—the radial menu for switching profiles and swiping up from the home screen to view the vaccination status QR code were both my ideas.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Process</h2>
                <p class="section-para">We began with a contextual inquiry, surveying a number of representative individuals about what they would expect from a proof of vaccination application, problems they expected to solve, and how they might fit the application into their lives. We consolidated this information using affinity diagrams, formulating a list of requirements and working up a series of user personas.</p>
                <p class="section-para">We distilled this list into a task inventory: log in/sign up, store and display vaccination information, record and access test result history, schedule new tests at a state provider, and manage a shared household— a behavior not included in the original brief that ended up being the most complex and engaging part of the design.</p>
                <p class="section-para">After reviewing our task inventory and discussing relevant design metaphors and inspirations, we separated to develop individual sketches of our interface. These were rough pen-and-ink exercises, but even here some trends emerged which would remain present through to the final design, especially the radial menu. We then regrouped and combined our rough sketches into a cohesive plan using a digital whiteboard tool.</p>
                <p class="section-para">We proceeded to develop the sketches into simple wireframes, establishing a basic layout for the key tasks of displaying vaccination status, entering vaccination information, and household management.</p>
                <p class="section-para">From this point we expanded our wireframing into an early mock-up. We settled on certain design components—a cool, calming color-scheme; standard button, input, and text styling; a pop-out hamburger menu for navigation; a radial menu for profile and household management—and built out the UI for all of our tasks.</p>
                <p class="section-para">We then put our design through its paces by conducting a summative evaluation. We had fifteen testers work through a series of scenarios, navigating our application and determining how easily they were able to fulfill the tasks of our brief. We recorded a significant amount of empirical data as well as a Systems Usability Scale survey and analyzed this to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.</p>
                <p class="section-para">Armed with this empirical evidence and stripped of our preconceptions and attachments, we went to work updating our design for a final submission. These changes ranged from the trivial—copy updates, changing clickable text into buttons, shifting components within a screen—to the complicated—implementing new menus to collect similar actions, updating all of our input field to include external labels rather than internal placeholders. We were ultimately able to implement every piece of feedback from our user evaluation for our final design and were proud with the final results.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Result</h2>
                <p class="section-para">The final design met the requirements of the original brief and extended to address scenarios discovered in our early user surveys. We iterated over a series of decisions, pursuing an interface that allowed for the utmost clarity and ease of use. We tested this with a battery of empirical and subjective evaluations, before producing a successful, thoughtfully designed final product. We created an interactive walkthrough and an overview of the components of our design iterations to review and explore our design.</p>
